# Regional-Revenue-Dashboard
Storytelling dynamic dashboard with Microsoft Excel and Power BI

COO was having trouble navigating the different dashboards the regional managers were presenting.
Requested I build a dynamic dashboard the regional managers can all input data into.


Excel: 

There is 2 tabs with data for new incoming months that can be inputted in the "Data" tab for a dynamic update to the dashboard


Power BI Dynmaic Update: 

After downloading excel file download the PBI file and link it to the excel workbook.
Connect "Data, Store, Region, Calander, Product Name, Product Category" tabs.
When inputting new data from August and/or September tab into the "Data" tab, go to "Calander" tab and drag the formula down.
Save excel file, refresh PBI dashboard
